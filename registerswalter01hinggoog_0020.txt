MS. in the following interesting Memoraudum, written with
his own hand, on a fly-leai at the beginning-“Quodnam
Registrum primi Walteri, Episcopi Exoniensis, de Anno
Domini ΜΟ. 000. L0. vij0. Et sciendum quod cancellacionesl
hie facte, vel per nigrum tracte, ab aliquo ignorante, vel non
pertinente, fiebant, qui Registrum, post necem secundi Walteri,
emit et retinuit multum diu.'’¹ Itis evident that Grandisson
took great interest in the Book3 for he annotated it in man
places, and numbered the folios throughout, beginning with
the ily-leaf on which he hed written his “Memorandum.”⁸

The page selected for the focetmth fairly represents the
Register.⁴ But the earlier folios are much more closely
written, end in smaller charactere, while the writing oi the
later folios is holder aud more widely spaoed.

¹'l'heyare numerous, and obviously “impertinent,”as the Bishop says. not tc,
for instance, containing the “Deposicio'’ of John (lhubbe, Abbot of Tevistoclr, is
canoelled ou both sides, and Grandiseon has written “ male trahi” on the uppermargiu.

t Sec the facslmlle. 'l'he words Et actardum lte,” were added subsequently.

⁸The MS. has been dlsfigured by numerous marginal referes written, apparently,
in the Sixtcenth century, and‚msu of them, mere¹ repetitions dilue original references,
which arefmeasier to read. hualdre latterwere carefully and eccuratdy mede·

Some rude attem tet an Index of Conteris will be found on the ily-leaves3 but they

r 'lhe word “Budoci,'’ which will be obeorved in tbe margin, is one of Grundieson’s
References. Itis of some interest, because it seems to shew thet, while the Corulsh
“ Saint '’ was always so described in formal Docurnents,⁸ thepreflx was, then rs now,

we should say) “Budock’ in theNote. And the like occurs ehewhere Forinetnnue,
