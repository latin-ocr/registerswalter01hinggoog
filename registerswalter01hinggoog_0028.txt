ουτ Bishop was a man 01 extraordinary energy and activity‚
,full 01 good works, and ever intent on romoting both the
spiritual and the worldly interests 01 his h'lock.¹ Oliver 10110
us that, in 1270, he obtained irorn the Orown a Market and
Fair for Bishopsteignton, and that, on the 8th 01 May in that
¹year, he rocured the Confirmation 01 the Royal Chartam

and severity-six years (Soe Ap ndix Ritu William oi
worcester, he adds, styled our Bis op “Walter le Goode,’' and
he merited the title by the excellence of his character and his
many munificent deeds. The Registrar 01 Newenham extols
' his numerous acts 01 bounty 10 that Abbey—his donation of
six hundred marks towards the building 01 the Conventual
Ghurch, and his gift 01 six Altars thereto, viz„ St. Gabriel's,
St. Thomas,’ and St. Katherine’s on the north side, and St.
John's, st. Anne’s, and St. N icholas‚’ on the south. The Grey
Friars 01 Bodmin venerated him as their special Benefactor.
At Olyst he rebuilt the Manet-House, which became the
favourite residence of his Successore, its gateway bearing the

the Collegiate Ohurch 01 Crediton 10 its antient s lendour,
and-moved thereto by a Dresm, as the Epita h on his
Tomb tells us-he founded another College (which he dedi·
cated 10 St. Thomas-theMartyr) at Glasney, near Penryn.
His Biographer repudiates‚ as well he might, “the senseless
calumny broached by Hoker, Godwin, an hacke, to depre-
ciate his memory,'’ in the matter 01 his a uisition 01 an
Estote called Bromburhe, together with the A vowson 01 the
Ohurch 01 ClystFomison3 for it stende victoriouelp⁷ refuted
in the Gonveyanee-Deed‚ fortunately preserved in his Regieter
(aee p. 50), which shows that he purchased the property 01
Richerd Fomison, the [ord of the Manor, the consideration
repeilvecli1 being twenty pounds 01 silver and an Estate called
“ 0 0 ore.”

Though the Bishop's activities as we have seen, were un-
ceasing, there is reason 10 believe that, physically, he was not
a robust man As early as 1264 we find him excusing his
nonattendance 01 the Parliament held, that year, 01 St. Alban's
