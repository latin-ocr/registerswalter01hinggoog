Bishop’e route on the hiup. Its reoihel might well be regarded ee almost in·
oredible, but ior the ieet that his Regiater reoords the work done et every plaoe,
und therehy inoreases our wonder. For iu the course oi some thirty days he
dedioeted no lower than twenty-one Ohurohee, in addition to attending to much
Diooesen work of other kinds. Weery and worn, we may well believe, he retired
to hie quiet Home at Ohudle' h ior a weelr'e rest, having oroeeed the great Moor.
And even here work aweited ' ,ior on November dth he dedioeted the Parish

Pariehee within a mouth, end dedioating no leee than thirteen Ohurohee l

It is evident that a great wave of real for the Houses of
God had swept over the whole Diooese, ior we find that,
between September, 1259, and the end oi 1268, the Bishop
wes called upon to dedicate eighty-eight re·built or enlarged
Churohes. Oi these Dedications iorty ooourred in a single
year. Many oi the old Senotueries, erected in Senon or in
Norman days, hed, probably, become deoayed, or, perhaps,
even ruinous, and demanded the Restorer's hand. And itis
interesting to be able to traoe in many instaures, even now,
the work that was done then. The beautiful little Ohuroh oi
St. Anthony-in-Roseland eruditum, with a centra] tower,
alone eomes down to us quite unohanged since the day on
whioh Bronesoombe dedicated it; and 1t tells ite own tale
clearly. Its builders spared the grand old south doorway of
the Norman Ohuroh, and all besides is their own work. I
have visited most of the Ohurohes on the list (see pp. 65-68);
and, though nearly the whole of them have been all but

The Bishop spent the greater part oi the year 1260 in
London, oooasionally visiting his Mauors in Surrey, Hants, and
Sussex. But August end September were devoted to his
