THE

EPISOOPAL REGISTERS

or 'm

DIOOESE OF EXE'l'ER

The Register of Bishop Walter Bronescombe is the earliest
of the long Series which (with few gaps,happily), extends from
hie Consecmtion in mor-8 to our own time.

We are told by Dr. Oliver (who, however, gives no authority
for the statement), that to this Prolate belongs the merit of
commencing a regular Register ol the Acts of the Bishops, and,
at any rate, it seems to be certain that no earlier Register
of his Predecessors, if any ever existed, is extant now. It
isprobable that their dots were not recorded in a Book,
buton separate sheets of vellum or paper, most of which have,
long ago, been dispersed or lost; the lew which survived being
bound up, witha viow ιο their preservation, in the First Volume
of the Series. These strey documento were stitched in, here
end there (a few being copied on blank spaces in the Register
iteolf), with no attempt at arrangement, and without the
slightest reference to the contenis of the folios to which they
were attached3 there are, also, some which belong to a
period subsequent to Bishop Bronescombe's death. All are
of considerable interest, end will be found arranged in
chronological orden—the latter inan Appendix3 tho former
in their proper place in order oi time. A few of these
documenta belong ιο the Episcopotes oi Bronescombe and

Quivil, and ere, oi course, dealt with in the General Index.
