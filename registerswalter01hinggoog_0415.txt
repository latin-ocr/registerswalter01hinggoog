ADDITIONAL NOTES, ETO„ TO BISHOP QUIVIL’S
REGISTER.

I think it expedient to print rin menso the portioris of this
Register which have been rendered practically illegibleb ,
theuso of galls. It is no ex geration to say that both
the peges of folio 128 look more ' e what is commonly called
a ‘¹ Poor Mau’s Plastm '' than anythin else, and other portione
of the MS. are scorcely less distigured. Some of the Entrics
are quite obliterated, and most of them have only been
deciphcred with the greatest difficulty, in a strong light,
and with the help oi a powerful gloss. Eveu so, I had to
return to many of them, over and over again, before I could
read them. It is not probable that any other person will,
hereaftcr, attempt such a task3 and, as the condition of these
folios is not likely to improve it would be a ity not to make
the most of the almost blinding labour whiehl have expended
upon them-recovering the mutilatcd record word by word,
and often letter by lettor. The facts and names which I was
able to deoipher while my Book was in preparation, I have, of
course, included in the “Index ”3 and while the sheets were
passing through the Press 1 have lost no opportunity of work-
