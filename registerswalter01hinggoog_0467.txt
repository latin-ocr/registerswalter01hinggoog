was confirmed by the Primate's authority.¹ Quivit, however, again appealed
and appointed John dc la Wede his Prootor on the tend ol October.
And herculeo, the record lrile us. But it eeeme certain that Pycot egem
won the day: ior he ie constantly referred to, in Pechham'e Regieter, ee
“Deen oi Exoter,” down to 1284 1 doubt very much whether Quivil
ever recognised him, end there is some curicus indirect evidence ol this in
his Register. ln ceses oi Institutione by the Biehop to Beneficee in the
gift oi the Chapter, we elweys lind the formula—“ad pmoentacionem Decoor'
et Capituli Exoniensie”; us, lor inatence, in the Institution to Heavitree,
16 April, 1280, y'uet before Dean Noble's death li theDeene was vacant
the Benefice was, commonly, eeid to bein the Giit oi the recident and
Chapter. Now, there were five Institutione to Chapter-Livings between
Pycot'e Confirmation by the Archbiehop and the Electicn oi Dean Andrew
de Kilhenny, hie euoceeecr, vin. Bucherell, in Dec, 12813001ebr00ke‚in
March, 1282& Littlehom, in the same montlr; Brenscombe, in Nor„ 128&
end St May-Major, Exeter, in dan, leet-4. In every instance the Bishop’s
Registrm wrote simply, and was, probably, directed to write-“ nd pre·
eentseicnem Capituli Exonieneisff’ No sooner ie Pycot removed, however,
and the new Deen in Office, than the old lormnls reappeers, in the case oi
the Institution to Upotte in Nou, 1285. lt ie hard to believe that thie was
not done deliberotnly. iior are other indicitions wanting oi the Biehop’s
hostile attitude towards thie obnoxioue cleric. He evesa canonos course¹
end, at one time, 1 thought thet he wer Treasnrer oi the cathedrel; but,
on further investigationl have como to the conclusion that the 'l'reasurer
wes another man, commonly known ee “John ol Exeter,” against whom Quivil
directed u Oommiesion, 27 Nov.,1282,tothe Prior oi St Michael's Mount,
in Cornwnll,—“super pluralitate Beneficiorum que obtinet cum cure aui·
marum, ct quibudam rebor oliir”; hinting at posdble Suspeneicn, Exccm·
munication, and Interdict Pycot, wer, certainly, aleo, a pluraliet-Rectcr oi
St. John-in-cornwall, which, however, hc resigned cn hie Institution to
Buckercll in 1272] oi Merton (though iore short time only); oi Affeton,
also, in addition to hie Osthedral Dignitr'ee. We find, moreover,
from Peclrham's Regieter, thet he war Rector oi Tamne-Gonnus? in the
Diooeee'oi flahtom in 1281, and (iol. 20812) ol Heauton-Puncbardon,
near Bernstsple. At the letter place he was in direct conflict with hie
Bishop, against whom he wes supported by the Primate, and not without
reoson il his story war true For thus Peckham writes (26 duly, 1284)
